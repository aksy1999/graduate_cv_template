# graduate_cv_template
Making this repository as a easy way to share my graduate school application CV. 
This repository provides the latex template for the CV. This CV was used by me for my PhD in ECE Graduate Applications for Fall 2021. I think it's a decent and balanced template. I got positive response from majority of graduate schools. 

Feel free to use and share it. 
Acknowledgment: The original github for this template is here: https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV. Also, I strongly acknowledge Naman Jain, who provided me with his template to begin with. Thanks Naman bro !
