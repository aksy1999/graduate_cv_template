# graduate_cv_template

**Why this GitRepo exists?**

Hi, I am Amit Yadav, I applied for PhD in ECE for Fall 2021 Graduate applications in USA. 
This repository is made as a easy way to share latex template of my graduate school application CV. 
This CV helped me to get admits from UCSD, UCSB, Purdue, UMichigan. I also heard from UT Austin. I think it's a decent and balanced template. I got positive response from majority of graduate schools, I applied to. 

**How to Use**

1. Easiest way it to download everything as a folder and upload it as a project to Overleaf. Compile the resume.tex file and you are good to go :)
2. For a fancy way to complie latex file refer below: (section taken from parent/acknowledge repo)
    
    **Requirements**

    A full TeX distribution is assumed. Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, *nix) are available but TeX Live is recommended. You       can install TeX from upstream (recommended; most up-to-date) or use sudo apt-get install texlive-full if you really want that. (It's generally a few years behind.)

    **Usage**

    At a command prompt, run

    $ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
    This should result in the creation of {your-cv}.pdf


**Contact**

You are free to take my .tex file and modify it to create your own resume. Please don't use my resume for anything else without my permission, though!
